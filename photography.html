<h2>Why I love photography?</h2>
<p>
Photographs are the universal language of our era. Everyone has hundreds, maybe thousands in their pocket. Weightless, they turn the scale when the argument is: What happened here? Images donâ€™t age or warp. A great photographerâ€™s strings never go out of tune.
</p>
<p>
I shoot because I see. I shoot because if I donâ€™t, I donâ€™t know who will. Activism is seen as a dirty word. I shoot because I find peace in being especially active, and being a vigorous advocate for a cause.

</p>
<p>
Photographers are the dedicated, passionate and sometimes half-crazy individuals who are willing to give their lives, too often quite literally, to show us what needs to be seen, what needs to be known. I can think of no greater honor nor privilege than to have lived a life surrounded by images and the amazing individuals who create them and share them with us.
